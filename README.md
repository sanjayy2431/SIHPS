## Problem Title
Development of e-Portal for facilitating Case Management Hearing of various types of cases
## Problem Description
Case Management Hearing, known as a Pre-Trial Conference" in other jurisdictions". This application is used for managing case files since filing to disposal and to complete all its related processes. The CMS keeps the records of all the cases filed in Delhi High Court. The system has following features: Filing of Case, Caveat matching, Allocation of case, Daily Case Proceedings, Notice Generation, Case Transfer, Case Status Search, Report, etc.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Law and Justice

## Idea
Advanced Search & Filtering: Enable users to filter facilities based on the specific e-waste types they accept, such as computers, TVs, or batteries.

Interactive Features: Introduce a quiz or an interactive map to make learning about responsible e-waste disposal more engaging. Provide a "responsible disposal guide" that offers step-by-step instructions for tasks like data wiping and preparing e-waste for recycling.

Data & Insights: Create a system to collect and analyze user-reported data on e-waste types and quantities, providing valuable insights to the Ministry of Environment.

## Technology Stack
Front-End:

HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the website.
CSS: Handles the styling of visual elements, including layout, fonts, and colors.
JavaScript Framework: ReactJS is a strong choice for delivering a dynamic and interactive user experience. It allows for the creation of reusable components and efficient management of complex data flows.
Back-End:

Database: PostgreSQL is recommended for storing various data, including:
E-waste facility details (locations, contact information, accepted waste types)
Educational content (text, images, videos)
User data (for a potential reward system) – secure storage practices like password hashing should be used for storing usernames, points, etc.
Device data (for a reward system) – model numbers and corresponding precious metal content (in collaboration with e-waste recycling companies).
API Integration:

Google Maps API: Essential for the facility locator functionality, enabling users to search for nearby facilities, view locations on a map, and get directions.
Optional API: For a reward system, you may need to integrate with APIs from e-waste recycling companies to access data on the precious metal content of various devices.


## Dependencies
Front-End and Back-End: Required technologies for building the user interface and server-side logic.
Database Management System: Essential for storing and managing data related to the e-waste facilities, users, and educational content.
Development Tools:

Code Editors: Necessary for writing and editing the code.
Version Control System: Critical for tracking changes, collaborating with team members, and managing the project's codebase.
Budget for the Project: ₹50,000 - ₹75,000

Time Period: 15 days to 1 month
