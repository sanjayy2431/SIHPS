## Idea
Idea:
Creating an e-Portal for case management and hearings can revolutionize legal systems, businesses, and other sectors that handle disputes or cases. Below are detailed points and ideas for developing such an e-Portal:

User-Centric Design

Role-Based Access: The portal should accommodate different user roles, including judges, lawyers, plaintiffs, defendants, administrative staff, and the general public. Each role should have customized access and interfaces.
Intuitive Interface: The portal should feature a clean, user-friendly interface that simplifies navigation and minimizes the learning curve.
Multi-language Support: To serve diverse user groups, the portal should offer support for multiple languages.
Case Management Features

Case Filing: Enable users to file new cases electronically, with the capability to upload documents, provide descriptions, and categorize case types.
Automated Case Numbering: Implement automatic generation of unique case numbers for tracking and reference purposes.
Hearing Management

Scheduling and Calendar Integration: The system should automate the scheduling of hearings with calendar integration, allowing users to view and manage their hearing schedules. The system could also suggest available slots based on the availability of judges and participants.
Collaboration and Communication Tools

Messaging System: Incorporate a secure internal messaging system for communication among case participants, including judges, lawyers, and administrative staff.
Security and Compliance

Data Encryption: Ensure that all data, particularly sensitive case details, are encrypted both at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.
Analytics and Reporting

Case Progress Reports: Provide automated generation of case progress reports, offering insights into timelines, bottlenecks, and case outcomes.

## Technology Stack
Front-End:

HTML: Provides the basic structure and content of the website.
CSS: Handles the styling of visual elements, including layout, fonts, and colors.
JavaScript Framework: ReactJS is a strong choice for delivering a dynamic and interactive user experience. It allows for the creation of reusable components and efficient management of complex data flows.
Back-End:

Database: PostgreSQL is recommended for storing various data, including:
E-waste facility details (locations, contact information, accepted waste types)
Educational content (text, images, videos)
User data (for a potential reward system) – secure storage practices like password hashing should be used for storing usernames, points, etc.
Device data (for a reward system) – model numbers and corresponding precious metal content (in collaboration with e-waste recycling companies).
API Integration:

Google Maps API: Essential for the facility locator functionality, enabling users to search for nearby facilities, view locations on a map, and get directions.
Optional API: For a reward system, you may need to integrate with APIs from e-waste recycling companies to access data on the precious metal content of various devices.

## Dependencies
Front-End and Back-End: Required technologies for building the user interface and server-side logic.
Database Management System: Essential for storing and managing data related to the e-waste facilities, users, and educational content.
Development Tools:

Code Editors: Necessary for writing and editing the code.
Version Control System: Critical for tracking changes, collaborating with team members, and managing the project's codebase.
Budget for the Project: ₹50,000 - ₹75,000

Time Period: 15 days to 1 month
